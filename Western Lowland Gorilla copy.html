    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The gorilla's coat color is black. Short, thin, gray-black to brown-black hair covers the entire body except the
      face. Western lowland gorillas may have a more brownish coloration. A small white tuft of hair on their rump
      distinguishes infants up to four years old. The white patch helps the mother keep track of the infant and assists
      other group members in identifying the gorilla as an infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mature silverback males have a saddle of white hair across the small of their backs. In western lowland gorillas,
      the silver may extend to rump and thighs. Western lowland females may go gray below the ears and on the neck and
      top of the head as they age. Compared to other subspecies, western lowland gorillas have a more pronounced brow
      ridge and ears that appear small in relation to their heads. They also have a differently shaped nose and lip than
      other subspecies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adult male gorillas' heads look conical due to the large bony crests on the top and back of the skull. These
      crests anchor the massive muscles used to support and operate their large jaws and teeth. Adult female gorillas
      also have these crests, but they are much less pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison to the mountain gorilla, the western lowland gorilla has a wider and larger skull, and their big toe
      is spread apart more from the alignment of the other four toes. Gorillas' arms are longer than their legs; when
      they move on all fours, they knuckle-walk, supporting their weight on the third and fourth digits of their curled
      hands. Like other primates, each individual has distinctive fingerprints. Gorillas also have unique nose prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gorillas are the largest of the great apes, but the western lowland gorilla is the smallest of the subspecies.
      Males are much larger than females. Adult males weigh an average of 300 pounds (136.1 kilograms) and up to 500
      pounds (226.8 kilograms). They stand up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Adult females weigh from 150 to 200 pounds
      (113.4 kilograms) and stand up to 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) tall. Adult males have an arm span of 8 feet (2.4 meters),
      and females have an arm span of 6.5 feet (2 meters).

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      No accurate estimates of their numbers are possible, as these elusive apes inhabit some of Africa’s densest and
      most remote rainforests. However, the total population is thought to number up to 100,000 individuals. In some
      areas they occur in surprisingly high densities – like in remote swamps or areas with dense leafy growth where
      they’ve been recorded at exceptionally high densities of almost 10 individuals per square kilometer.

    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      Western lowland gorillas are broadly distributed across the Congo Basin, and are more or less continuously
      distributed across the countries of Gabon, Central Africa Republic, Cameroon, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and
      Congo. Though present historically in the Democratic Republic of Congo, they are now likely extinct there. Western
      lowland gorilla ranges have been measured from 9 to 14 square miles (14.5 to 22.5 square kilometers), rarely
      overlapping other troops. The average distance traveled in a day is usually less than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers),
      with longer distances traveled when more fruit is abundant. Because of their large size, gorillas spend most of
      their time on the ground.

    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Disease</h5>
    <p>
      Central Africa is home to not only gorillas, but also the deadly Ebola virus. Ebola has caused a number of massive
      gorilla and chimpanzee die-offs in the remote forests at the heart of the primates’ ranges. Some scientists
      estimate that it has killed about one third of the wild gorilla population, mostly western lowland gorillas. The
      toll has been even greater in some areas, such as the Minkébé Forest—once considered one of the most important
      populations—where the virus may have killed more than 90% of the region’s gorillas and chimpanzees.
    </p>
    <h5>Poaching</h5>
    <p>
      The hunting and killing of gorillas is illegal but still the animals are killed for bushmeat or during the capture
      of baby gorillas for pets. In Northeast Congo, about 5% of western lowland gorillas in that region are killed each
      year. Timber and other companies have opened areas of once remote forest, facilitating poaching and the bushmeat
      trade. Poaching also carries dangers for humans as it is thought that Ebola may be spread through the butchering
      and handling of gorilla and other primate meat.

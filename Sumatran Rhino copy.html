    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The two-horned Sumatran rhinoceros shares the bleak distinction of world’s most endangered rhino with its regional cousin, the Javan rhino, both species of which are listed as critically endangered.
    </p> 
    <p>  
      The smallest of the five living rhino species, the Sumatran rhino’s hide is dark red-brown in color and covered with patches of short, dark, stiff hair. The hair helps keep mud caked to the body, which cools its skin and protects it from insects. The Sumatran rhino’s two horns are considerably smaller than those of their African relatives, the black rhinos and white rhinos. The front horn may grow up to 31 inches but is normally much smaller, while the posterior horn may grow up to three inches but is generally no more than a hump.
    </p> 
    <p>    
      Sumatran rhinos are the smallest of the living rhinoceroses and the only Asian rhino with two horns. They are covered with long hair and are more closely related to the extinct woolly rhinos than any of the other rhino species alive today. Calves are born with a dense covering that turns reddish-brown in young adults and becomes sparse, bristly and almost black in older animals. Sumatran rhinos compete with the Javan rhino for the unenviable title of most threatened rhino species. While surviving in possibly greater numbers than the Javan rhino, Sumatran rhinos are more threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The remaining animals survive in small, fragmented non-viable populations, and with limited possibilities to find each other to breed, its population decline continues. Just two captive females have reproduced in the last 15 years.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      The Leuser Ecosystem in the northern part of Indonesia’s Sumatra Island is one of the last refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis). The species’ global population is fewer than 80 individuals. Apart from perhaps as many as a dozen in Indonesian Borneo, all live on Sumatra. They all survive in small and isolated populations, with some considered to be doomed as they are not viable enough to survive in the long term.
    </p>

<div class="Container" id="Habitats">
    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      Sumatran rhinos once could be found throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in the dense mountain forests of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Myanmar, as well as the foothills of the Himalayas in Bhutan. Now, however, the only remaining viable population lives in isolated pockets of Indonesia, mainly on the island of Sumatra.

    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Illegal wildlife trade</h5>
    <p>
      Growing consumer demand for rhino horn has driven the unsustainable increase in poaching across Africa and Asia. Rhino horn is coveted in parts of Asia for its purported medicinal qualities and as an ornament, often carved, which connotes social status and prestige.
    </p>
    <p>
      China and Vietnam are the two largest consumer markets for rhino horn. Demand in China began escalating in the 1990s in tandem with booming economic growth. Investigations by TRAFFIC, the world’s largest wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF reveal that use of rhino horn in traditional medicine persists in many countries.
    </p>
    <h5>Habitat loss</h5>
    <p>
      Sumatran rhino habitat is being lost or degraded by invasive species, road construction, and encroachment for agricultural expansion. For example, Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra is losing forest cover due to conversion for coffee and rice by illegal settlers.
    </p>
    <h5>Lack of protection</h5>
    <p>
      Protection is insufficient in existing protected areas. When rhinos move outside of protected areas, communities are not sufficiently engaged or incentivized to protect them.
    </p>
    <h5>Small population size and isolation</h5>
    <p>
      Due to small numbers, low probability of breeding pairs encountering one other, and reproductive problems among aging females, we believe breeding among wild Sumatran rhinos to be minimal in most locations. Most—if not all—of the remaining sub-populations are too small to be viable long-term breeding populations.

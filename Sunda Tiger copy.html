    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      Sumatran tigers are the smallest tiger subspecies. These also tend to be more bearded and maned than the other
      subspecies. Once they prowled across several parts of the Sunda islands in Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunda tigers are distinguished by heavy black stripes on their orange coats, giving them the perfect camouflage to
      mimic light reflection on the forest floor. Accelerating deforestation and rampant poaching mean this noble
      creature could end up extinct like its Javan and Balinese counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumatran tigers were previously known as Panthera tigris sumatrae but in 2017 the IUCN Cat Specialist Group
      revised tiger taxonomy, recognising just two tiger subspecies: Panthera tigris sondaica, comprising the Sumatran
      and (now extinct) Javan and Balinese populations, and Pantheratigris tigris, comprising the Bengal, Malayan,
      Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and (extinct) Caspian tiger populations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetic profiling shows that the Sumatran Tiger is different from the other mainland species. The theory is that
      they were isolated from the other species thousands of years ago due to a rise in the sea level.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      Fewer than 400 Sunda tigers remain on the island of Sumatra. Deforestation is the main threat to the species's
      survival.

    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Illegal wildlife trade</h5>
    <p>
      Most tigers in Sumatra are killed deliberately for commercial gain. According to a survey from TRAFFIC, the global
      wildlife trade monitoring network, poaching for trade is responsible for almost 80% of estimated Sumatran tiger
      deaths—amounting to at least 40 animals per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite intensified conservation and protection measures in parts of Sumatra and some success in curtailing
      markets for tiger bone, there is little evidence that tiger poaching has declined significantly on the island
      since the early 1990s.
    </p>
    <h5>Human-wildlife conflict</h5>
    <p>
      Dispersal of tigers in search of their territory and habitat destruction forces tigers out of protected areas and
      into human-occupied spaces— where they are more likely to come into conflict with people. Like other parts of the
      tiger’s range, human-tiger conflict is a serious problem in Sumatra. People have been killed or wounded, and
      livestock falls prey to tigers. Retaliatory action by villagers can result in the killing of tigers.
    </p>
    <h5>Habitat loss</h5>
    <p>
      Habitat for the Sumatran tiger has been drastically reduced by clearing for agriculture (particularly oil palm),
      plantations, and settlement. On many parts of the island, illegal timber harvesting, and forest conversion are out
      of control. Between 1985 and 2014, the island’s forest cover plunged from 58% to 26%. Even protected areas face
      problems. In addition, forest conversion has isolated national parks from one another, along with populations of
      species like tigers that need large areas for breeding, feeding, and dispersing.

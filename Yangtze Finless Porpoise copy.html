    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most porpoises they don’t have a fin on their back or a beak. They have a rounded head and are a dark to pale grey colour. They have moderately large flippers. They can’t breathe under water, so have to come to the surface regularly to breathe air. They weigh up to 72kg. They don’t leap out of the water like a dolphin, but they do like to ‘spy hop’ – this is when they look like they are standing up in the water and then use their fins to spin round so they can see what’s happening.    
    </p>
    <p> 
    The Yangtze River, the longest river in Asia, used to be one of the only two rivers in the world that was home to two different species of dolphin—the Yangtze finless porpoise and the Baiji dolphin. However, in 2006 the Baiji dolphin was declared functionally extinct. This was the first time in history that an entire species of dolphin had been wiped off the planet because of human activity. Its close cousin, the Yangtze finless porpoise, is known for its mischievous smile and has a level of intelligence comparable to that of a gorilla.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      After years of rapid decline, the latest census shows that the population of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise has remained almost stable in recent years – dropping very slightly to 1012 individuals from 1040 in 2012.

    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      The Yangtze finless porpoise is found in the main Yangtze river channel in central and eastern China, and in two lakes, naturally connected to the river, in the central Yangtze - Dongting and Poyang and in two oxwbow lakes, Tien ezhou and He wangmiao, where they have been recently translocated to..

<div class="Container" id="Threats">
    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <p>
      Finless porpoises need an abundant food supply for survival. The destruction of the Baiji dolphin food supply was central to its extinction. Overfishing is the main factor that contributes to the decrease in finless porpoises’ food supply, but pollution and ship movement are factors as well.

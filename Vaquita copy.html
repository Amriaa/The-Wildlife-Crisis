    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      Vaquita, the world's rarest marine mammal, is on the edge of extinction. The vaquita has a large dark ring around
      its eyes and dark patches on its lips that form a thin line from the mouth to the pectoral fins. Its top—the
      dorsal surface—is dark gray, its sides are pale gray, and its underside—the ventral surface—is white with long,
      light gray markings. Newborn vaquita have darker coloration and a wide gray fringe of color that runs from the
      head to the flukes, passing through the dorsal and pectoral fins. They are most often found close to shore in the
      Gulf's shallow waters, although they quickly swim away if a boat approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world’s smallest porpoise, vaquitas measure up to five-feet long and weigh up to 120 lbs. The vaquita’s unique
      facial markings of a black ring around each eye and black curved lips have been compared to a smiling panda. They
      are dark gray on their dorsal (top) surface with pale gray sides and a white underside with light gray markings.
      Newborns generally have darker coloration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vaquita, Phocoena sinus, is the world’s smallest cetacean, weighing around 55 kilos. Females grow to be around
      1.5 metres long. They are longer than the males, whose length tops out at about 1.4 metres. They eat small fish
      and squid. They have unique facial markings with a black ring around each eye and curved, black lips that make
      them look as if they are smiling. 5 Their dorsal surface is dark grey, their sides pale grey, and their underside
      is white with light grey markings. Newborn calves are darker. Vaquita have proportionally large dorsal fins,
      possibly as an adaptation to warmer water to allow heat to dissipate. Like other porpoises, vaquitas use sonar to
      communicate and navigate. Vaquitas are very rarely seen. When they are spotted, they are either alone or in small
      groups of two or three. They are thus thought to be quite solitary animals. Researchers estimate that vaquita live
      for around 20 years.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      The plight of cetaceans—whales, dolphins, and porpoises—as a whole is exemplified by the rapid decline of the
      vaquita in Mexico, with about 10 individuals remaining. This little porpoise wasn't discovered until 1958 and a
      little over half a century later, we are on the brink of losing them forever. Vaquita are often caught and drowned
      in gillnets used by illegal fishing operations in marine protected areas within Mexico's Gulf of California. The
      population has dropped drastically in the last few years.

    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      Vaquitas only live in the northern end of Mexico’s Gulf of California. Besides the vaquita, the Gulf of California
      has tremendous biological and economic importance. It supports an extraordinary diversity of marine life including
      sharks, whales, marine turtles, and many species of reef fish. The Upper Gulf of California is considered globally
      unique because of its ecological characteristics, enormous biodiversity and the amount of species that live in
      this area.

    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Illlegal wildlife trade</h5>
    <p>
      The vaquita will be extinct if fishery bycatch is not eliminated immediately. Nearly one out of every five vaquita
      get entangled and drown in gillnets intended for other marine species like the totoaba, a critically endangered
      fish also found in the upper Gulf of California. Entanglement in gillnets set for totoaba was the primary cause
      that brought the vaquita to low levels by the mid-1970s. Totoaba were overfished by the mid-1970s and were listed
      as endangered by Mexico in 1975, and by the US in 1979.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, international trade in totoaba is banned under CITES, a global agreement among governments to regulate or
      ban international trade in species under threat, but high demand from China for its swim bladder has led to a boom
      in illegal totoaba fishing in the past few years. Demand for totoaba swim bladders has been driven by the belief
      in Chinese medicine that they are a cure to a variety of illness and diseases. Thousands of swim bladders are
      dried and smuggled out of Mexico, often through the United States. Fishermen receive around $4,000 for each pound
      of totoaba swim bladder, equivalent to half a year's income from legal fishing activities. It is this illegal
      trade that is currently driving the sharp decline in vaquita numbers.

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      Saola is a recently discovered species of large mammals. They are known as the 'Asian Unicorns'. Scientific
      community heard about saola for the first time in 1992. This unique-looking animal lives only in the forests on
      the border of north-central Vietnam and Laos. Saola is also known as Asian unicorn because it is rarely seen in
      the nature and people sometimes think of saola like it is an imagined creature. Saola prefers life in dense
      forests that have good supply of running water (near the riverbanks). Although not much is known about saola, it
      is listed as critically endangered species due to accelerated habitat loss and hunt. Horns of saola are collected
      as a trophy while other parts of its body serve as ingredients in folk medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of a saola is akin to an antelope, though cattle are the closer genetic cousins. This unusual
      combination made the scientific classification so difficult that a new biological tribe was created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both male and female Saola, have two parallel long, straight, pointed horns that have been measured to reach up to
      an amazing 20 inches (50 cm), twice the size of their head. Their silky, short fur is a dark chestnut brown colour
      apart from the distinctive beautiful white markings above their eyes, like an eyebrow, beside the nose and along
      the jaw line. A lighter, cream colouring is also found just above the hooves and on the chest. The tail is short,
      coloured by three stripes that give the appearance of a zebra crossing, brown at the top, cream in the middle and
      the fluffy end is black.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation
      of Nature (IUCN). Formal surveys have yet to be taken to determine accurate population numbers, but the IUCN
      estimates the total population to be between 70 and 750 and declining. About 100 animals reside in protected
      areas.
    </p>

  <div class="Container" id="Habitats">
    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      The saola is only known from the slopes of the Annamite Mountains, a restricted mountainous jungle on the
      northwest-southeast border between Vietnam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos). The region is a
      subtropical/tropical moist environment which is characterized by evergreen or mixed evergreen and deciduous
      woodlands, and the species seems to prefer edge zones of the forests. Saola are presumed to reside in mountain
      forests during the wet seasons and move down to the lowlands in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The species is presumed to have been formerly distributed in wet forests at low elevations, but these areas are
      now densely populated, degraded, and fragmented. Low population numbers make distribution particularly patchy. The
      saola has rarely been seen alive since its discovery and is already considered critically endangered. Scientists
      have categorically documented saola in the wild on only four occasions to date.

  <div class="Container" id="Threats">
    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Hunting</h5>
    <p>
      Saola are often caught in snares set in the forest for wild boar, sambar or muntjac deer. Local villagers set some
      snares for subsistence use and crop protection. Recent increases in lowland people hunting to supply the illegal
      trade in wildlife has led to a massive increase in hunting, driven by traditional medicine demand in China and
      restaurant and food markets in Vietnam and Laos.
    </p>
    <h5>Habitat loss</h5>
    <p>
      As forests disappear under the chainsaw to make way for agriculture, plantations and infrastructure, saola are
      being squeezed into smaller spaces. The added pressure from rapid and large-scale infrastructure in the region is
      also fragmenting saola habitat. Conservationists are concerned that this is allowing hunters easy access to the
      once untouched forest of the saola and may reduce genetic diversity in the future.

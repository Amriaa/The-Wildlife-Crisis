        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            The Sumatran Elephant is the smallest subspecies, but the largest mammal existing on the island of Sumatra.
            They can weigh up to 5tonnes and reach 9ft in height! With a stranger appearance to their African cousins,
            the Sumatran Elephant is almost completely bald with small rounded ears. Female Sumatran Elephants rarely
            have tusks, but the females that do keep them hidden away from sight until they open their mouths!
        </p>
        <p>
            Sumatran elephants are the smallest Asian elephants, meanwhile differing from the other 2 sub-species
            morphologically, anatomically and genetically by brighter skin with less de-pigmented spots. Males of
            Sumatran elephant generally exhibit visible tusks, which don't tend to grow long. Tusks of female elephants
            are extremely short, usually being hidden under the upper lip.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian
            elephant, and native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. In general, Asian elephants are smaller than
            African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like
            process. Their back is convex or level. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.
            Sumatran elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.2 m (6.6 and 10.5 ft), weigh between 2,000 and
            4,000 kg (4,400 and 8,800 lb), and have 20 pairs of ribs. Their skin colour is lighter than of maximus and
            indicus with the least depigmentation.

        <h2>POPULATION</h2>
        <p>
            The Sumatran elephant was once widespread on the island, and Riau Province was believed to have the largest
            elephant population in Sumatra with over 1,600 individuals in the 1980s. In 1985, an island-wide rapid
            survey suggested that between 2,800 and 4,800 elephants lived in all eight mainland provinces of Sumatra in
            44 populations. Twelve of these populations occurred in Lampung Province, where only three populations were
            extant in 2002 according to surveys carried out between September 2000 and March 2002. The population in
            Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park was estimated at 498 individuals, while the population in Way Kambas
            National Park was estimated at 180 individuals. The third population in Gunung Rindingan–Way Waya complex
            was considered to be too small to be viable over the long-term.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 2008, elephants had become locally extinct in 23 of the 43 ranges identified in Sumatra in 1985,
            indicating a very significant decline of the Sumatran elephant population up to that time. By 2008, the
            elephant was locally extinct in West Sumatra Province and at risk of being lost from North Sumatra Province
            too. In Riau Province only about 350 elephants survived across nine separate ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of 2007, the population of Sumatran elephants is estimated to be 2,400–2,800 wild individuals, excluding
            elephants in camps, in 25 fragmented populations across the island. More than 85% of their habitat is
            outside of protected areas.

        <h2>HABITATS</h2>
        <p>
            Sumatran elephants are endemic only to Sumatra Island (Indonesia), where these animals inhabit areas nearby
            rivers in lowland forests as well as hill forests during certain seasons.
        </p>

    <div class="Container" id="Threats">
        <h2>THREATS</h2>
        <h5>Human-elephant conflict</h5>
        <p>
            As a result of the rapid development and deforestation in Sumatra, elephants often come into contact with
            human settlements. They raid crops, trample homes and sometimes even hurt or kill people. Those affected
            sometimes retaliate and poison or shoot elephants.
        </p>
        <h5>Poaching</h5>
        <p>
            Sumatran elephants typically have smaller tusks but they are enough to tempt poachers who kill the animals
            and sell their tusks on the illegal ivory market. Only male Asian elephants have tusks so every poaching
            event further skews the sex ratio further constraining breeding rates for the species.
        </p>
        <h5>Deforestation and habitat loss</h5>
        <p>
            In 2012, the Sumatran elephant was changed from “Endangered” to “Critically Endangered” because half of its
            population has been lost in one generation—a decline that is largely due to habitat loss and as a result
            human-elephant conflict. Sumatra has experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation within the Asian
            elephant’s range, which has resulted in local extinctions of elephants in many areas. Over two-thirds of its
            natural lowland forest has been razed in the past 25 years and nearly 70 percent of the Sumatran elephant’s
            habitat has been destroyed in one generation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Sumatra’s Riau province, pulp and paper industries and oil palm plantations have caused some of the
            world’s most rapid rates of deforestation. Elephant numbers have declined by a staggering 80 percent in less
            than 25 years, confining some herds to small forest patches. These populations are not likely to survive in
            the long-term. The Lampung province has seen its number of elephant herds decline from twelve in the 1980s
            to only three by 2002. Just two of the remaining herds are considered biologically viable.

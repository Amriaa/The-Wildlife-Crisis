    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The Sumatran Orangutan, one of two Orangutan subspecies, is now found only in the dense, tropical northern forests
      of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Generally, they prefer the lowland forest areas that are abundant in food,
      but some have been spotted hanging out in altitudes higher than 1,000 meters above sea level. This is mainly a
      consequence of aggressive deforestation destroying the lowland habitat. Unlike other apes, like gorillas and
      chimpanzees, it will be very rare to find a Sumatran Orangutan wandering the forest floor. In fact, they are the
      largest ‘arboreal’ animal in the world. This means they spend almost all of their time high up in trees and will
      travel around by swinging from branch to branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support their Tarzan-tree-hopping way of life, their arms are incredibly strong and comparatively long to the
      size of their legs. Also, their hands and feet are capable of an iron grip to help with swinging and reaching.
      In a lifetime, they will cover large areas of land, but day to day, they only move up to a tiny half mile. This is
      no surprise however, as they spend 60% of their day filling their bellies with a variety of food from fruit like
      mangos, lychees and durians to termites, eggs and even honey taken from bee hives using a variety of intelligent
      techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orangutans in general, unlike other apes, are solitary apart from when females have offspring. However, Sumatran
      Orangutans are known to be more social than Bornean Orangutans as they tend to feast together on the sweet fruits
      of Sumatra’s fig trees. In comparison with their orangutan cousins that live in Borneo, the Sumatran Orangutan is
      slightly smaller, has lighter hair, and a longer beard. The males also have slimmer cheek pads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Male Sumatran orangutans grow to about 1.7 m (5.6 ft) tall and 90 kg (200 lb). Females are smaller, averaging 90
      cm (3.0 ft) and 45 kg (99 lb). Compared to the Bornean species, Sumatran orangutans are thinner and have longer
      faces; their hair is longer with a paler red color.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      A survey published in March 2016 estimates a population of 14,613 Sumatran orangutans in the wild, doubling
      previous population estimates. A survey in 2004 estimated that around 7,300 Sumatran orangutans still live in the
      wild. The same study estimates a 20,552 km2 occupied area for the Sumatran orangutans, of which only an
      approximate area range of 8,992 km2 harbors permanent populations. Some of them are being protected in five areas
      in Gunung Leuser National Park; others live in unprotected areas: northwest and northeast Aceh block, West Batang
      Toru river, East Sarulla and Sidiangkat. A successful breeding program has been established in Bukit Tiga Puluh
      National Park in Jambi and Riau provinces.

    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      Sumatran orangutans are only found in a very small part of the world. They live in the northern section of the
      Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is how they got their name. They are most common in the Aceh province, which
      is on the very northern tip of the island. The orangutan's range used to cover far more of Sumatra, but now it is
      only found in this small region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumatran orangutans are tree-dwelling creatures. They rarely, if ever, come down to the ground. As a result, they
      live in heavily forested areas, and are found in forests and swamps in both high and low elevations. This species
      is mostly found in primary forests, which are forests that have not been disturbed or previously cut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Sumatran orangutans have an extremely low tolerance for any kind of habitat disturbance. In areas where
      logging occurs, their population can drop by more than half, even if logging is selective and the forest is not
      cleared. Unfortunately, the Aceh government has plans to open up more land for logging and oil-palm plantations.
      This land is currently protected, and removing this protection would be disastrous for the Sumatran orangutan.

  <div class="Container" id="Threats">
    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Hunting</h5>
    <p>
      Despite legal protection in Indonesia since 1931, orangutans are still captured from the wild and kept in
      households as status symbols. In some areas orangutans are hunted for food. Investigations by TRAFFIC, the global
      wildlife monitoring network, shows that lack of law enforcement against this illegal trafficking poses a serious
      threat to orangutans. Females give birth to just one infant at a time every eight or nine years, making their
      populations very susceptible to even very low levels of hunting. Experts estimate that even as little as 1% of
      females lost each year through hunting or other unnatural causes could put a population on an irreversible
      trajectory to extinction.
    </p>
    <h5>Habitat loss</h5>
    <p>
      Orangutan habitat in north Sumatra is being lost at an extremely high rate, mainly due to fire and conversion of
      forests to oil palm plantations and other agricultural development. This species depends on high-quality forests.
      Widespread forest fires, many set deliberately to clear land for plantations, are becoming a regular disaster. Not
      only do fires destroy vast areas of orangutan habitat, but thousands of these slow-moving apes are thought to have
      burned to death, unable to escape the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plan to build a major road in northern Sumatra threatens one of the largest-remaining areas of the orangutan’s
      habitat. Not only will the road fragment the forest, but it will also open up access for illegal logging
      activities and human settlements. The project is progressing despite proof that conserving the region will help
      long-term sustainable development.

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The name orangutan means "man of the forest" in the Malay language. In the lowland forests in which they reside,
      orangutans live solitary existences. They feast on wild fruits like lychees, mangosteens, and figs, and slurp
      water from holes in trees. They make nests in trees of vegetation to sleep at night and rest during the day. Adult
      male orangutans can weigh up to 200 pounds. Flanged males have prominent cheek pads called flanges and a throat
      sac used to make loud verbalizations called long calls. An unflanged male looks like an adult female. In a
      biological phenomenon unique among primates, an unflanged male can change to a flanged male for reasons that are
      not yet fully understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bornean and Sumatran orangutans differ a little in appearance and behavior. While both have shaggy reddish fur,
      Sumatran orangutans have longer facial hair. Sumatran orangutans are reported to have closer social bonds than
      their Bornean cousins. Bornean orangutans are more likely to descend from the trees to move around on the ground.
      Both species have experienced sharp population declines. A century ago there were probably more than 230,000
      orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated at about 104,700 based on updated geographic range
      (Endangered) and the Sumatran about 7,500 (Critically Endangered).
      A third species of orangutan was announced in November, 2017. With no more than 800 individuals in existence, the
      Tapanuli orangutan is the most endangered of all great apes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most arboreal of the great apes, orangutans spend most of their time in trees. They have proportionally long
      arms and short legs and their hair is reddish-brown. Adult males may develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and
      make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger males do not and resemble adult females.
      Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes, social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their
      dependent offspring, who remain together for the first two years. Fruit is the most important component of an
      orangutan's diet, but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. They can live over 30
      years both in the wild and in captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct
      elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes' learning abilities have been studied
      extensively. There may be distinctive cultures within populations. Orangutans have been featured in literature and
      art since at least the 18th century, particularly in works which comment on human society. Field studies of the
      apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas and they have been kept in captive facilities around the
      world since at least the early 19th century.

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>
    <p>
      The largest remaining species of orangutans is the Bornean species (Pongo pygmaeus). However, recent estimates
      reveal that only between 50,000 and 100,000 orangutans live in the wild in Borneo today. Even more critical is the
      pressure on the orangutans in Sumatra, where populations of less than 14,000 (Pongo abelii) and 800 (Pongo
      tapanuliensis) orangutans also face the overwhelming risk of extinction. The latest estimates from the IUCN
      indicate a general annual loss of 3,000-5,000 orangutans.
    </p>

  <div class="Container" id="Habitats">
    <h2>HABITATS</h2>
    <p>
      The remaining wild populations of orangutans live in the rainforest, usually in low-lying peat forests and other
      fertile rainforests in Borneo and Sumatra. They primarily live above the ground and in the forest canopy, and they
      are the largest arboreal mammals. Over 60 percent of the orangutan’s natural habitats in Indonesia and Malaysia
      have been destroyed over the last four decades.

  <div class="Container" id="Threats">
    <h2>THREATS</h2>
    <h5>Hunting and illlegal wildlife trade</h5>
    <p>
      Orangutans are an easy target for hunters because they're large and slow targets. They are killed for food or in
      retaliation when they move into agricultural areas and destroy crops. This usually occurs when orangutans can't
      find the food they need in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Females are hunted most often. When caught with offspring, the young are often kept as pets. The pet trade is a
      major problem. It is thought that for each orangutan reaching Taiwan, as many as 3-5 additional animals die in the
      process. Recent enforcement of the law in Taiwan has reduced the importation of orangutans, but the trade remains
      a threat in Indonesia where there is still demand for orangutans as pets. There is also trade in orangutan skulls
      in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo).
    </p>
    <h5>Deforestation and habitat loss</h5>
    <p>
      The habitats of Asia's only great apes are fast disappearing under the chainsaw to make way for oil palm
      plantations and other agricultural plantations. Illegal logging inside protected areas and unsustainable logging
      in concessions where orangutans live remains a major threat to their survival. Today, more than 50% of orangutans
      are found outside protected areas in forests under management by timber, palm oil and mining companies.
